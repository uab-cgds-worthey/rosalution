# Summary

One in ten individuals lives with a rare genetic disease; ~50% are children. Recent advances have revolutionized our
ability to identify candidate and confirmed causal molecular changes (variants). Hundreds of thousands of variants now
await functional confirmation. A major bottleneck is the need for characterization of these variants to: generate
definitive diagnoses, aid in understanding of pathogenic mechanisms, guide the development of accurate predictive
models, and refine existing or suggest new therapeutic approaches. Rosalution is an open-source full-stack web
application developed by the software engineering team within the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Center
for Precision Animal Modeling (C-PAM) to support collaboration between researchers and physicians working on modeling
rare disease in animal models. The mission of the UAB C-PAM is to provide a national modeling service to aid patients,
researchers, and physicians in diagnosing and treating rare genetic diseases. The models, materials, tools, and data
generated are made available to the collaborators who nominated the candidate variant of interest (nominator) and the
broader research and clinical community. Rosalution streamlines data collection, quality control, standardization, and
integration. It also supports the analysis process, guiding and collecting the decisions made during case and variant
consideration. It is designed not only to facilitate analysis and generation of biological insights for an
individual case, but also aims to enrich subsequent data mining and process improvement for meta-analyses.

# Statement of Need

Gene editing approaches are used to generate precision disease animal models (e.g., cells, worms, zebrafish)
carrying patient derived variants. Understanding the specific cellular and molecular impact of these variants in
such model systems support the efforts to derive, diagnose, and provide therapies for ultra-rare diseases. Generating
these models can take months to years.

The process of vetting candidate variants is generally a manual, non-systematic, and inefficient process, performed
using different methods and datasets generated or curated by hundreds of cell and molecular biology labs worldwide.
Researchers invest many hours gathering data and reviewing candidates using a series of disparate tools. Project
tracking that collected information and any additional generated data are rarely available in an accessible and
structured format. Criteria used in decision-making often need to be better standardized, validated, or tested.
Both ingested and generated data and metadata are often incompletely retained and thus lost for reuse. We developed
Rosalution to centralize these collaborative efforts via an accessible website client and application programming
interface (API). A design-first approach was selected and focused on creating a seamless experience that guides
teams through a collaborative analysis process keeping functionality and accessibility in mind. The Rosalution web
client implements this design as a VueJS single-page architecture (SPA) website and a FastAPI Python service enabling
programmatic access following the OpenAPI standard, which deploys interactive API documentation. Rosalution
persistently stores its state in a MongoDB NoSQL database.

Rosalution facilitates three aspects of the case review process:

- Augmenting and standardizing case and variant/gene intake and annotation with configurable automated annotation from
  publicly available data sources \autoref{tbl:datasources}
- Supporting expert curation by clinical and research experts via a web-based interface
- Supporting synchronous and asynchronous collaborative review by interdisciplinary teams via a web-based interface

# Analysis Intake

![A compilation of Rosalution screenshots of an analysis with its supporting evidence attachments.\label{fig:analysis}](./docs/paper/analysis_supporting_evidence.jpg)

New cases in Rosalution are uploaded as a JSON file either via the web client user interface (UI) or web API. The data
for analysis is structured programmatically from a predefined template populated with data from the uploaded JSON.
Once the new case persists in the database, the API sends an HTTP response noting successful creation. Researchers
then begin preparing the case within the Rosalution web client with additional insights and supporting evidence, as
seen in \autoref{fig:analysis}. In the background, the Rosalution API queues an annotation task for each dataset
associated with the case's variants, genes of interest, and clinical data. These annotation tasks are processed in an
external thread pool to not block incoming HTTP traffic to Rosalution's API, keeping the application free to use while
performing annotation in the background. An abstract Python class defines annotation tasks with an interface for
subclasses to implement reading datasets from a specified data source. Once fetched, the data is returned to a Python
dictionary to be extracted and saved in the database using the `jq` Python module. The application provides the `jq`
module with the query to extract the dataset's value as defined in the configuration of the annotation task. This
design supports simul annotating from a variety of disparate sources of REST APIs and databases referenced in
\autoref{tbl:datasources}, with planned support in the future of variant call format (VCF) files, databases, etc.

# Collaborative Analysis

Within the UI, Rosalution displays a summary of the case (gene, variant, nominator, and unique ID) as a case card. A
subset of recent case cards shows along with a search bar. Selection of a case opens the case record. The web client
splits data in the record into two sections.  The case section shows clinical and case specific genetic information,
including age, sex, onset, literature evidence, variant data/interpretations, disease and phenotype associations, prior
testing, and clinical utility statements.

Genes and variants of interest are presented at the top of the record as seen in \autoref{fig:annotations}. Clicking on
either the gene or variant renders its annotations. Variant-specific data, including pathogenicity, allele frequency,
impact, druggability, functional associations, and cellular context are presented.

![A compilation of Rosalution screenshots of an analysis and annotations for the gene and variants of interest.\label{fig:annotations}](./docs/paper/analysis_annotations.jpg)

When displaying annotations, the web client queries the web API for a configuration stored in the database that
determines how annotations are displayed. By investing in implementation of a configurable visual rendering we can
rapidly adjust the data representation based on how the users are using the data.

A research team member is assigned to review and add any pertinent annotations from the patient records. The
application's web client interacts with the web API to persist the changes. Once the case is open and assigned for
analysis additional collaborators can further curate by adding additional supporting evidence and files as they
review the case prior to the review meeting. Curating is done by attaching hyperlinks to online resources or files
supplemented with comments. During review meetings, when the entire assigned team seeks to decide on the nomination,
any novel data used to make decisions are attached to the case as part of the review process. This way, all expert
curations and important datasets integrate into a case within a single repository as a compilation of data and
visuals added.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, Rosalution is an open source tool for facilitating collaborative analysis for model generation in the
rare genetic disease research community. It supports the process of animal modeling from case intake to decision
making. Benefits of this platform include (1) more efficient data analysis through aggregation and automated annotation
as well as support for both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration, (2) a reduction in errors via a focus on
increasing data standardization and reducing knowledge loss by supporting the real-time collection of curations and
evidence via a web-based user interface and API, and (3)  an increase in data sharing with its focus on ability to
data mine across all records. Rosalution shows potential for growth and scalability as it opens its development to
the broader open-source and open-science communities.
