## Contributing

To get started on contributing to Rosalution:

- Choose an existing feature/bug listed under issues.
    - If the feature/bug is not listed under issues, create the feature request/bug.
    Only start work on it once request is accepted.
- Fork and create a new branch for your work.
- Submit a pull request with adequate documentation of functionality and changes made.
Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Linting and Static Analysis

Please ensure that your branch passes static analysis when submitting a pull request.

- To run linting in `./frontend/`

  ``` bash
  yarn lint:auto
  ```
  
- To run linting in `./backend/`

  ``` bash
  pylint src tests 
  ```

- To run linting for markdown `.md` files

  We use a dependency called markdownlint.
  For installation/setup instructions, refer to [markdownlint's Github repo](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint).
  Please reference our configuration files for additional linting rules.

To reference configuration files:

- General & Markdown: `./etc/static-analysis/`

- Backend: `./backend/.pylintrc`
