        * (optional) If from local development version: Verified environment setup environment with `.setup.sh` and sourced shell, then `docker compose up`

        * Open the browser and call the endpoint `/`.
        * It renders an empty rosalution dashboard.
        * But I expected it to route me to the login page.
